    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no security measures are completely foolproof, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Under PIPEDA and PIPA, you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access and update your personal information.</li>
        <li>Request the deletion of your data.</li>
        <li>Object to the processing of your data.</li>
        <li>Withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, please follow the procedures outlined below.</p>

    <h2>6. Retention of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by law. When your personal information is no longer needed, we will securely destroy or anonymize it.</p>

    <p><strong>Deletion Requests:</strong> If you wish to delete your personal information, you can request this by submitting a written request via one of the following methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mail:</strong> Send a written request to us at the address provided below. Please include sufficient information to verify the legitimacy of your request, such as your full name, email address associated with your account, and any other relevant details.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Processing Deletion Requests:</strong> Upon receiving a deletion request, we will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verify your identity to ensure the legitimacy of the request.</li>
        <li>Assess the request to determine if any legal obligations require us to retain certain information.</li>
        <li>Allocate a processing period of up to 60 days to ensure there are no pending legal obligations or investigations that necessitate retaining your information.</li>
        <li>If retention is necessary, we will inform you of the reasons and the extent of data that cannot be deleted.</li>
        <li>Proceed with deletion of all other personal information that is not subject to legal retention.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We strive to respond to all deletion requests within 60 days of receipt. If additional time is needed, we will inform you accordingly.</p>

    <p><strong>Profile Visibility:</strong> For safety reasons, we strongly encourage users to disable the visibility of their profiles instead of deleting their accounts. Disabling visibility allows us to maintain necessary records while protecting your privacy and enhancing the security of our community.</p>
    <p>By requiring deletion requests to be submitted via mail, we ensure that all requests are thoroughly verified, thereby maintaining the integrity and security of our platform. This approach helps prevent unauthorized or malicious attempts to delete information, contributing to the overall safety of our community.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
