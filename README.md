## Project Goals

This repository exists to provide:

- transparency and auditability
- a practical, deployable reference implementation
- a durable foundation that cannot be paywalled, sabotaged, or captured
- an alternative to monopoly-driven dating infrastructure

CompanioNation™ exists to make sure that **at least one viable dating platform can always remain free**, without:

- artificial scarcity (likes, swipes, matches)
- engagement manipulation or dark patterns
- paywalls on basic human interaction
- algorithmic teasing designed to extract money rather than foster connection

It is about time that we, the people, took back control of the online dating infrastructure that shapes so much of our social lives.
CompanioNation™ measures success in human outcomes, not engagement metrics — built for people, not profit.

Future plans include partnering with local organizers to facilitate CompanioNation™ branded local offline events, meetups, and community-building activities.
If you or someone you know might be interested in organizing such events, please get in touch!

# Developer Setup

Welcome to the CompanioNation™ project.

This guide helps you set up a **local development environment** using local services and emulators. No cloud resources are required for development.

---

## CI/CD

Ask Drew McPherson (drew.mcpherson@gmail.com) to run the CI/CD pipeline for you, and the current build will be pushed to the Azure staging server
located at: https://companionationpwa-alt.azurewebsites.net

---

## 🔧 Required Tools

- [.NET SDK 10 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [SQL Server Express LocalDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb)
- Visual Studio 2022+ (recommended)

---

## 🧪 Optional (Local Emulation)

- Azure Storage Emulator (Azurite)  
  Used only if you enable blob storage locally. Visual Studio can provision this automatically.

---

## ▶️ Run / Debug locally

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Set the `CompanioNationAPI` project as the startup project.
3. Select the `https` launch profile for `CompanioNationAPI`.
4. Press F5 (Debug) or Ctrl+F5 (Run) — this starts the API and the Blazor WebAssembly front-end together.

---

## 🔐 Login with Google

CompanioNation™ supports authentication via Google OAuth. 

**⚠️ Important:** OAuth can fail if browser developer tools debugging is enabled. If you encounter authentication failures during login:

1. Keep the Visual Studio debugger running
2. Open a **new browser instance** (without developer tools attached)
3. Navigate to `https://localhost:7114`
4. The login will work in the new instance

This occurs because OAuth validates the browser session, and active debugging can interfere with the validation process.
